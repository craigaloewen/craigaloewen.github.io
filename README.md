# Craig Loewen's Personal Website

This is the code form my Personal Website. It uses Jekyll and Google analytics and is based upon a template from Start Bootstrap which can be found here:
[Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Freelancer Jekyll Version](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

[Freelancer Jekyll Version](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/1-col-portfolio/) is a Jekyll build for the Freelancer portfolio theme based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

This blog also used code from the [Jekyll Doc's repository](https://github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme).
