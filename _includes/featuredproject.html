                    to use any touch screen.
                    The project was my Fourth Year Design Project for my Mechatronics Engineering Degree at the
                    University of Waterloo.
                    We ended up winning the national James Dyson award for all of Canada as well as the General Motors
                    Innovation Award, and the 2nd place in the people's choice award. <br /> <br />
                    The WatVision system includes an app, and a ring that you wear on your finger. You run the app, and
                    point the camera at the touch screen
                    you wish to interact with. The app will tell you when it's seen and understood the screen. After
                    that, you can move the finger wearing
                    the ring around the screen and it will read out to you whatever is underneath your finger. If you
                    want to learn more (or see it in action)
